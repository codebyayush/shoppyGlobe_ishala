git repository-  https://github.com/codebyayush/shoppyGlobe_ishala
I have also used my second github ID- ayushcodesatwk
to commit changes from another device.

// I have not created other repo for this project, it was mentioned that
// the project is for shoppyGlobe so I have used the same repo.


// I have connected frontend with backend and implemented 
// all the route (given in the pdf) in the backend as well as in the frontend 
// all the tasks that are given are completed I have attached screenshots

// each and every API are working fine I have tested using thunderclient 
// and also by using the frontend

// I have used middleware to check if the user is logged in or not 
// in each route of cart before calling the API.

// I have used MVC structure to implement this project
// used middlewares to check if the user is logged in or not

// implemented JWT token authentication also 
// all the routes of authentication, products & cart are working fine
// user can only see their cart and can add or remove products from the cart

// all the frontend and backend code is working fine, the project is working without errors

Thank you
